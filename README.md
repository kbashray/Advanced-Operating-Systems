Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of several key components typically studied in Advanced Operating Systems. The project focuses on understanding the fundamental principles of modern operating systems, including process scheduling, memory management, synchronization, and file systems.

The following modules are covered in this project:

Process Scheduling Algorithms
Memory Management (Paging, Segmentation)
Synchronization (Mutexes, Semaphores, Monitors)
Inter-process Communication (Pipes, Message Queues, Shared Memory)
File System Implementation
Virtualization and Containers
